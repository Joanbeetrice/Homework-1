Under federal law, all hospital prices in the United States are required to be publicly available. However, accessing this information can be challenging for the general public. We've initiated an open data initiative to gather these hospital prices and compile them into a centralized database.
The initial phase involves linking the standard charge files, which associate hospital procedures with both their "gross charges" and the negotiated rates with all insurance providers.

NPI (National Provider Identifier)
TIN (Taxpayer Identification Number)
Both are essential for legal and billing purposes.

NPI and TIN are fundamental tools for accurately identifying healthcare providers and organizations, streamlining administrative processes, ensuring regulatory compliance, and maintaining financial integrity in hospitals.
