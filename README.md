Business Case:

Analyzing charges issued by the DCWP provides critical insights for regulatory authorities to enforce compliance with consumer protection and licensing laws. The dataset aids in identifying non-compliance patterns, optimizing resource allocation, informing policy adjustments, and enhancing overall regulatory efficiency. This data-driven approach enables targeted interventions to mitigate risks, improve consumer protection, and ensure businesses adhere to local, state, and federal regulations.
